# Voice Assistant

## The voice assistant created using Python, incorporates Web Scraping to help in daily tasks.

### The tasks that the voice assistant can help in are as follows:
#### 1. Getting weather information 
#### 2. Searching the meaning for a word
#### 3. Writing notes
#### 4. Reading existing notes
#### 5. Showing the top news
#### 6. Playing a YouTube Video

### Limitations:
The Voice Assistant uses the Speech Recognition module and the text-to-speech conversion library "pyttsx3". The "engine" used to show the results from the voice assistant incorporates the Microsoft Speech API (sapi5), which would not show the results for Mac OS X. As an alternative, NSSpeechSynthesizer can be used for Mac OS X.

# Voice Assistant

## The voice assistant created using Python, incorporates Web Scraping to help in tasks.

### The tasks that the voice assistant can help in are as follows:
1. Get weather information 
2. Search the meaning for a particular word
3. Write notes
4. Show existing notes
5. Show the top news
6. Play a YouTube Video

### Limitations:
The Voice Assistant uses the Speech Recognition module and the text-to-speech conversion library "pyttsx3". The "engine" used to show the results from the voice assistant incorporates the Microsoft Speech API (sapi5), which would not show the results for Mac OS X. As an alternative, NSSpeechSynthesizer can be used for Mac OS X.
